## 0. Preamble

Thank you very much for using my Hosts lists. You're so lonely you have to.

Take the time to read this, lost Internet user.

> Some folders include a `README` file. Please read them as well.

## 1. Definitions

- “I” shall refer to Cyanic, Cyanic76.
- “You” shall refer to the Tester and/or the User of those lists.
- “Hosts”, “The Lists” refer to the Hosts lists available in this repository.
- “The License file” refers to the MIT license file you may find at the root of the repository.

## 2. Reporting Issues

By creating an Issue or a Pull Request, you make sure that it is not a duplicate of any existing Issue or Pull Request, including open and closed ones.

### a. Pull Requests

When creating Pull Requests, you should add your hosts in alphabetical order. "B" goes after "A", etc.

## 3. New domains

When asking for new domains to be added, it is **your duty** to make sure they're not already in the lists.

## 4. Removals

When asking for a removal, you must provide a **valid reason** (like [this](https://codeberg.org/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/7)) and a list of hosts that shall be removed with regards to that reason.

## 5. Duplicates

If you create an issue that gets discarded for being a duplicate, you become subject to the conditions mentioned in 6).

### a. allhosts

I know that this feature may be broken sometimes with or without a reason. [I **am aware of this**](https://codeberg.org/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/6). Any open Issue or Pull Request related to this, excluding #6, will result in being discarded.

## 6. Not reading the Code of Conduct

If, for any reason (including duplicates) and in any case, any Issue or Pull Request do not abide by these rules, its author will not try to:
- Create an Issue or a Pull Request,
- Publish a review on a Pull Request,
- Add a reaction to an Issue or a Pull Request, including comments,
- Comment on an Issue or a Pull Request.

Any user creating an Issue or a Pull Request related to `https://hosts.cyanic.me/corporations/Microsoft/microsoft.txt` will be subject to the above conditions.

Issue #4 is not subject to this. Therefore, any comment made by anyone else than their author or the repository
owner to that Issue will be deleted.
