The **main list**, `https://hosts.cyanic.me/cyanicHosts.txt`, includes 1400+ telemetry, advertisements, annoyances and unnecessary hosts. Get rid of them: add it to your adblock (like Pi-Hole or AdAway).

**NEW!** I've started a [cookie banners](https://hosts.cyanic.me/corporations/Other/cookie_banners.txt) hosts list.

# You choose what to block

Block corporations **as you like**. There's **32** files for you to choose from.

# What's **next**?
