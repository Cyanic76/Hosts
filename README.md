# Cyanic's Hosts list

This is pretty much my personal blocked hosts list.

## Basics

### Get the hosts list running

Add [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/main/cyanicHosts.txt) to your adblock so it can automatically download and keep it updated.

### Adding new hosts

To add new hosts, [create a new issue](https://github.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/new) or fork the repo and add the hosts, then create a pull request.

## Other

### Statistics

Not calculated lol
