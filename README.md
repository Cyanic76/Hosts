# Cyanic's Hosts list

This is pretty much my personal blocked hosts list.

## Basics

### Get the hosts list running

Add [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/main/cyanicHosts.txt) to your adblock so it can automatically download and keep it updated. Normally, you should update it daily or [subscribe to new releases notifications by mail](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications).

### Adding new hosts

To add new hosts, [create a new issue](https://github.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/new) or fork the repo and add the hosts, then create a pull request.

### Did blocking a certain host just broke a website, service, app?

Please tell me more in a [new issue](https://github.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/new).

## Other

### Statistics

**Over 200** hosts are blocked.
