# Cyanic's Hosts lists

All my hosts lists for you to add to your adblocker.

## Use the main hosts list

Add `https://hosts.cyanic.me/cyanicHosts.txt` to your adblock (like Pi-Hole or AdAway). All of the requests that are made to the specified domains will be redirected to 0.0.0.0 (nowhere).

## Choose what you want to block

The goal is to [block standard ad and tracker domains](https://hosts.cyanic.me/cyanicHosts.txt) and [if you want to block corporations](https://codeberg.org/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/1), you choose what you want/need to block.
