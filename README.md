# Cyanic's Hosts list

This is pretty much my personal blocked hosts list.

## Use the hosts list

Add [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/main/cyanicHosts.txt) to your adblock (like Pi-Hole). Download it, and all of the hosts should be blocked.

You should make your adblock check for updates daily, or as soon as I publish a new commit.

## Contributing

You may find that blocking a domain or sub-domain causes a website to not work correctly. File an issue or a PR if necessary.

Before filing a new issue or PR, [search in the existing ones](https://github.com/search?l=&q=is%3Aissue++repo%3ACyanic76%2FHosts&type=issues).

If you can't find any issue related to yours, [create a new one](https://github.com/Cyanic76/Hosts/issues/new). If you wish to add new hosts on your own instead, fork the repo and create a PR.
